# Requirements

## 1. Task Assignment

To determine your task, follow these steps based on the last 4 digits of your registration number:

Step 1: Take the last 4 digits of your registration number. (0077)
Step 2: Calculate the remainder when dividing the 4 digits by 4. (77 % 4 = 1)
Step 3: Add 1 to the remainder obtained in Step 2. The result will determine your task’s serial number. (1 + 1 = **2**)

Example, if your registration number is 20BCE0123, take the last 4 digits (0123) and divide them by 4. Since the remainder is 3, your task’s serial number is 3+1=4. Perform the task mentioned across the obtained serial number.
