## Task 2

### Title

Create a Total Stake Counter for Cardano, Polkadot, and Kusama Chains

### Description

Your task is to develop a Total Stake Counter application that allows users to track the total stake for three different blockchain networks: Cardano, Polkadot, and Kusama. The application should track the total amount staked with the Luganodes validator for each chain. The user interface (UI) should have options to add and remove chains from the tracking list.

### Requirements

- Implement a web-based UI for the Total Stake Counter.
- The UI should display the total stake value for each chain (Cardano, Polkadot, and Kusama).
- Find the relevant APIs to fetch the total stake data for each chain. Do not perform web-scraping from external explorers.
- Provide options in the UI to add and remove chains (among Cardano, Polkadot, and Kusama) from the tracking list.
- Ensure the application is responsive, user-friendly, and visually appealing.
- Use appropriate frameworks and libraries to simplify development (e.g., React, Vue, Angular, etc.).
- Use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes and share the final codebase.

### Deliverables

- The complete source code of the application.
- Clear instructions on how to run the application locally.
- A brief documentation explaining the implementation details, technologies used, and how to interact with the UI.
- Ensure the application works without any issues and meets all the requirements stated above.

### Technology Stack

- Front-end: React.js, Next.js (or other JavaScript frameworks).
- Back-end: Node.js, Express.js (or other suitable back-end frameworks).
- Database: MongoDB, PostgreSQL (or any preferred database).
